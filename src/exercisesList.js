    description: `The bench press is an upper-body weight training exercise in which the trainee
                  presses a weight upwards while lying on a weight training bench. 
                  The exercise uses the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps,
                  among other stabilizing muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, 
                  but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.`,

    description: `Deadlift refers to the lifting of dead weight (weight without momentum),
                  such as weights lying on the ground. It is one of the few standard weight training exercises
                  in which all repetitions begin with dead weight. In most other lifts, there is an eccentric 
                  (lowering of the weight) phase followed by the concentric (lifting of the weight) phase. 
                  During these exercises, a small amount of energy is stored in the stretched muscles and 
                  tendons in the eccentric phase if the lifter is not flexible beyond the range of motion.
                  Although this exercise uses the legs and hips as the primary movers, it can also be considered a back exercise.`,

    name: "Squat",
    description: `A squat is a strength exercise in which the trainee lowers their hips from a standing position
                  and then stands back up. During the descent of a squat, the hip and knee joints flex while
                  the ankle joint dorsiflexes; conversely the hip and knee joints extend and the ankle joint
                  plantarflexes when standing up. Squats are considered a vital exercise for increasing the strength and size of the lower body
                  muscles as well as developing core strength. The primary agonist muscles used during the squat are
                  the quadriceps femoris, the adductor magnus, and the gluteus maximus.`,

                  the body is suspended by the hands and pulls up. As this happens, the elbows 
                  flex and the shoulders adduct and extend to bring the elbows to the torso.`,

    description: `A push-up is a common calisthenics exercise beginning from the prone position. 
                  By raising and lowering the body using the arms, push-ups exercise the pectoral muscles, 
                  triceps, and anterior deltoids, with ancillary benefits to the rest of the deltoids, 
                  serratus anterior, coracobrachialis and the midsection as a whole. Push-ups are a basic 
                  exercise used in civilian athletic training or physical education and commonly in military 
                  physical training.`,

    description: `The overhead press (abbreviated OHP), also referred to as a shoulder press, military press,
                  or simply the press, is a weight training exercise with many variations. It is typically performed
                  while either standing or sitting sometimes also when squatting, in which a weight is pressed straight
                  upwards from racking position until the arms are locked out overhead, while the legs, lower back and
                  abs maintain balance. The exercise helps build muscular shoulders with bigger arms, and is one
                  of the most difficult compound upper-body exercises.`,

                  The bent over row is often used for both bodybuilding and powerlifting.

                  that involve brachioradialis, front deltoid and the main target on biceps brachii.
                  Includes variations using barbell, dumbbell and resistance band, etc. The common point
                  amongst them is the trainee lifting a certain amount of weight to contracting the biceps
                  brachii, and tuck in their arms to the torso during the concentric phase. Once the biceps brachii
                  is fully contracted, then return the weight to starting position during the eccentric phase.`,

                  Lying triceps extensions are one of the most stimulating exercises to the entire triceps muscle
                  group in the upper arm. It works the triceps from the elbow all the way to the latissimus dorsi.
                  Due to its full use of the Triceps muscle group, the lying triceps extensions are used by many
                  as part of their training regimen.`,

    description: `Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals
                  to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which
                  all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). A feature of a running
                  body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy
                  within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and
                  passive muscle elasticity. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting. `,
